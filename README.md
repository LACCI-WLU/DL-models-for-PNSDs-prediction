# DL-models-for-PNSDs-prediction
We upload six deep learning (DL) models of our research (DOI:) in this repository. The file end with CVAO means the model trained on the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory dataset while the ASI means the well-trained model tranferred to the Ascension Island dataset.

You can use keras.models.load_model(file) for file in this repository.

If you have any question about these models, please connect chengyuhan@westlake.edu.cn.
