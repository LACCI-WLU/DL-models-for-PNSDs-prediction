# DL-models-for-PNSDs-prediction
We upload six deep learning (DL) models of our research (DOI:) in this repository. 

The file ends with CVAO, which means the model was trained on the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory dataset, while the ASI means the well-trained model after being transferred to the Ascension Island dataset.

You can use keras.models.load_model(file) for files in this repository.

If you have any questions about these models, please contact chengyuhan@westlake.edu.cn.
